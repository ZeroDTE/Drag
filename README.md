# Drag and Drop Scheduler (App.js)

## Overview
This React application is a dynamic drag-and-drop scheduler designed for managing warehouse operations and flight logistics. It allows users to organize tasks, employees, trucks, and flights across different sections (Brandabschnitte) with real-time visual feedback and deadline monitoring.

## Key Features

### 3. Deadline Monitoring
- Visual deadline tracking for Frachter
- Color-coded warning system:
  - Blinking red indicators for approaching deadlines
  - Darker red for passed deadlines
- Customizable deadline times per airline

### 4. Employee Status Management
- Track employees who are:
  - Sick
  - On vacation
  - Coming later (with specific times)

### 5. Section Management
- Four main sections (Brandabschnitte 3-6)
- Dynamic subsection creation/removal
- Flexible layout adjustment

### 6. Data Persistence
- Local storage backup
- SharePoint integration for data storage
- Schedule history tracking
- Export functionality to CSV

## Configuration Objects

### Airlines and Deadlines
const frachterDeadlines = {
  'CA': '10:00',
  // Add more airlines and their deadlines here
};

const airlineLogos = {
  'CA': '/air-china-logo-.png',
  'SV': '/Saudi-Arabian-Airlines-Logo.png',
  // Add more airline logos here
};

### Time Slots
const timeSlots = ['06:00', '08:00', '10:00', '12:00', '14:00', '16:00'];
const comingLaterTimes = ['09:00', '11:00', '14:00'];

## Visual Feedback System

### Deadline Warning States
1. **Pre-Warning (60-30 minutes before deadline)**
   - Slow blinking (1.5s interval)
   - Light red background

2. **Warning (30-15 minutes before deadline)**
   - Medium blinking (1.0s interval)
   - Red background

3. **Urgent (15-0 minutes before deadline)**
   - Fast blinking (0.5s interval)
   - Bright red background
